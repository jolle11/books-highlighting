LIFE TIME
INTRODUCTION
p.3 - Sleep and daily rhythms emerge from our genetics, physiology, behavior and the environment, and like most of our behaviors they are not fixed. These rhythms are modified by our actions, how we interact with the environment, and how we progress from birth to old age. From infancy to advanced adulthood, our body clock and sleep patterns change profoundly, but these agent-related changes are not necessarily bad. We should stop worrying about our sleep and accept that 'different' is not necessarily worse.
------
p.4 - Another often repeated myth is that the pineal gland hormone melatonin is a 'sleep hormone'. It is not, and in the following chapters I shall explain why.
------
2. A HERITAGE FROM OUT CAVE DAYS - WHAT IS SLEEP AND WHY DO WE NEED IT?
NREM sleep, memory and anxiety
p.34 - NREM sleep has been linked with our ability to form memories and solve problems.
------
REM sleep, dreams and mood
p.35 - We dream in both NREM and REM sleep but dreams in REM sleep tend to be longer, and more intense, complex and bizarre.
------
What is the role of melatonin?
p.40 - Bright light, detected by the eyes, also acts as a 'biological signal of the dark'. While melatonin production occurs at night during sleep in day-active animals such as ourselves, in nocturnal animals, like rats and badgers, melatonin is also produced at night when these animals are active. So melatonin can't be a universal 'sleep hormone'. But what does melatonin do in us? Certainly, the tendency to sleep in humans is closely correlated with the melatonin profile, but this may be correlation and not causation.
------
p.42 - So, in summary, the consensus based on the data, is that melatonin seems to have a small direct action to promote sleep and/or it may provide an additional signal to tell the brain that it is night-time, and this is used to augment entrainment by light.
------
p.45 - Sleep is a period of physical inactivity during which time an individual avoids movement withing an environment to which it is poorly adapted, while using this time to undertake a range of essential biological activities that allow optimum performance during activity.
------
p.48 - 5. Is there any truth to the saying 'You need your beauty sleep'? ... Studies have shown that when people are overtired they appear less attractive to other people. This may be because tired people produce more of the stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol rises in response to inflammation in your body, and cortisol can lead to a breakdown in collagen, the connective tissue of your skin, and water retention, so your skin looks swollen and less attractive. ...

3. THE POWER OF THE EYE - ENTRAINMENT AND THE CYCLE OF DAWN AND DUSK
p.52 - As discussed, one most striking feature of circadian rhythms, across all life forms, is that they are not exactly 24 hours. The 'period' of the circadian rhythm is either shorter or longer than 24 hours.
------
What is the effect of light-emitting screens?
p.65 - The bottom line is that devices should not be used for at least 30 minutes before bedtime - not because of the light they produce, but because of the alerting activity they induce within the brain.
------
4. OUT OF TIME - THE NIGHTMARES OF STRESS, SHIFT WORK AND JET LAG
Seeking out (or avoiding) light to cure jet lag?
p.85 - The basic 'rule of thumb' is that if you travel west from the UK, you seek out light in the new time zone; if you travel east from the UK for more than 6-8 time zones, then avoid morning light in the new time zone but seek out afternoon light. As we discussed in chapter 3, light shifts the clock differently at different times of the day. Light around sunset (dusk) delays the clock, so we go to bed later and get up later the next day. Light around sunrise (dawn) advances the clock so we go to bed earlier and get up earlier the next day, Because light at different times can either advance or delay the clock, it is essential when crossing several time zones that light exposure in the new time zone moves the clock in the correct direction.

p.91 - 3. Why do I yawn? ... But, people yawn for a variety of reasons and we yawn when we are tired, bored, anxious, hungry, or about to start a new or difficult activity. ...

5. BIOLOGICAL CHAOS - GENERATING SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHM DISRUPTION
The seven major classifications of SCRD currently used are summarized here
------
Category 1 - Insomnia
- Sleepiness and fatigue
- Waking in the middle of the night - biphasic and polyphasic sleep
- Self-imposed polyphasic sleep
------
Category 2 - Circadian rhythm sleep/wake disorders
- Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD)
- Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD)
- Freerunning, or non-24-hour sleep/wake disorder
- Fragmented, or arrhythmic, sleep
------
Category 3 - Sleep-related breathing disorders
- Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). OSA is also a risk factor for stroke and heart conditions including: bradycardia, where the heart rate is too slow; supraventricular tachycardia, where your heart suddenly beats much faster than normal; ventricular tachycardia, where the lower chamber of the heart (ventricle) beats too fast to pump blood; and atrial fibrillation, where the heart rate is irregular and often rapid.
- Central sleep apnoea (CSA)
- Sleep-related hypoventilation disorders
- Sleep-related hypoxemia disorder
------
Category 4 - Central disorders of 'Hypersomnolence'
p.108 - Narcolepsy affects an estimated 1 in every 2000 people in the United States, so about 200000 Americans and approximately 3 million worldwide. ... Narcolepsy causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times because the brain is unable to regulate the sleep/wake cycle normally. ... Some individuals may fall asleep suddenly and without warning, and experience narcolepsy with cataplexy, which is the temporary loss of muscle control leading to collapse. Such cataplexy can be triggered in response to emotions such as laughter and anger. Yet other individuals with narcolepsy may also experience sleep paralysis, which is a temporary inability to move or speak when waking up or falling asleep.
------
Category 5 - Parasomnias
- Confusional arousal
- Sleepwalking
- Sleep terrors
- Sleep-related eating disorder (SRED)
- REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD)
- Sleep paralysis
- Bruxism
------
p.112 - Other parasomnias include: simple sleep talking; sleep-related hallucinations, which are imagined events that seem very real; frequent nightmares that prevent you from getting a good night's sleep which often result in insomnia; beedwetting (nocturnal enuresis), which is common in children and occurs when a person urinates by accident during sleep.
------
Category 6 - Sleep-related movement disorders (SRMDs)
------
Category 7 - Other sleep disorders
------
6. BACK IN THE RHYTHM - SOLUTIONS TO SLEEP AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHM DISRUPTION
What should I do during the day?
- Morning lighting
Most of us should get as much morning natural light as possible.
- Taking a nap or siesta
- Exercise
- When to eat
- Coffee and tea
- Stress
------
What could I do before bed?
- Light levels and computer screens
- Sleeping tablets and sedatives
- Difficult discussions
- Taking a bath
------
How do I make my bedroom a haven for sleep?
- The bedroom
- Sleep apps
------
What should I do in bed?
- Routine
Sleeping in for an extra few hours on a Saturday or Sunday morning may feel like a good idea to try and catch up on the sleep you missed during the working week, but sadly it usually does not help you make up the sleep debt you have accumulated. True, you may be a bit less drowsy or even stressed during that day, so it can help short term, but sleeping in will not wipe out the accumulated effects of sleep loss on your health. In addition, by sleeping in you will not get the necessary morning light exposure to set your circadian rhythms
- Consensual sex
- The mattress
- Lavender and relaxing oils
- Earplugs
- Lying in bed awake
Under such circumstances, it is important no to activate stress responses by remaining in bed and becoming increasingly frustrated. You may want to leave the bed, keep the lights low an engage in a relaxing activity such as reading or listening to music.
- Worrying about dreams
- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and nightmares

7. THE RHYTHM OF LIFE - CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS AND SEX
p.144 - Conception is the act of conceiving offspring, and across the biological world it is a complex, and sometimes dangerous, business. It is all about getting the correct materials in the right place, in the right amount, at the right time.
------
When to have sex
p.145 - Menstrual cycles can range from around 21 to 40 days, with only about 15 per cent of women having so-called 'normal' cycles of 28 days. ... The menstrual cycle has three phases: the follicular phase - getting the ovary and uterus ready before release of the egg; the ovulatory phase - release of the mature egg; then fertilization of the mature egg bu sperm in the fallopian tube.
------
p.147 - Next is the lutheal phase, getting the uterus ready to receive the fertilized egg (zygote) - or not. ... If the zygote is implanted, the cells around the developing embryo produce a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Pregnancy tests are based upon detecting rising levels of hCG.

9. TIME OUT OF MIND - THE EFFECTS OF TIME ON COGNITION, MOOD AND MENTAL ILLNESS
Cognition, time of day and SCRD
p.201 - Cognition describes a broad range of the processes within the brain that are needed to gather information and then understand, store and respond appropriately. In many instances actions will draw upon memories and previous experiences. There are three key elements to cognition: attention, whereby we notice key features in the environment and filter out 'irrelevant' information; memory, which describes out ability to retain and retrieve information, initially as a transient memory before it becomes 'set' into long-term memory; and executive function, which relates to our brain's ability to plan, monitor and then control complex behaviours that achieve specific goals or enable us to complete specific tasks.
------
p.208 - The development of memory is divided into three processes: acquisition, or encoding, whereby a new memory is formed, but it is susceptible to being forgotten; consolidation, when new memories are gradually turned into a long-term, stable memory; and the retrieval, or recall, of a consolidated memory. Consolidated, or long-term, memories are divided into two types: declarative memories are those memories that are under conscious control and which we recall as facts and concepts, often called 'common knowledge', such as understanding the difference between a dog and a cat or knowing that Richard Wagner wrote Der RingDes Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung); and procedural memories are those memories relating to how we perform different actions and skills. Basically, memories of how you do certain things such as riding a bike, tying your shoelaces or cooking a Beef Wellington.
------
p.220 - 1. How are  anxiety, depression and sleep loss linked? This is thought to be a very important set of interactions. In brief, the connections would be as follows. Anxiety will increase the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Stress will act to disrupt sleep and circadian rhythms and this will impact upon two key areas: SCRD will alter cognition and promote a negative 'salience' (increased prominence). The world will appear worse than it is, predisposing to depression; and SCRD will also disrupt multiple neurotransmitter pathways in the brain that regulate mental health. Such disruption will predispose to the worsening of mental health states.

10. WHEN TO TAKE DRUGS - STROKE, HEART ATTACK, HEADACHES, PAIN AND CANCER
Stroke and heart attack
p.231 - The autonomic nervous system consists of two parts - the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches. The sympathetic branch drives an increase in heart rate, while the parasympathetic system has the opposite effect and reduces heart rate. Both are regulated by the circadian system with parasympathetic activity higher at night and the sympathetic system peaking in the morning, leading to the rise in blood pressure and heart rate.
------
Cancer
p.247 - Disrupted circadian rhythms have also been reported in colorectal cancer, and the more severe the disruption the lower the chances of survival. Such findings have given rise to the idea that approaches which stabilize the circadian timing of cancer patients will not only improve their quality of life, but also their chances of survival. These methods are detailed in chapter 67, but include:
1 - The timing of meals
2 - Appropriate light exposure around dawn ans dusk
3 - The reduction of light in the evenings
4 - Consistent sleep/wake schedules
5 - Appropriate sleeping space, including night-time darkness, appropriate temperature, good mattress and pillows, etc.
6 - Minimal use of sleeping medications
7 - Increasing daytime alertness and discouraging napping
8 - Avoiding stimulants such as caffeine close to bedtime, etc.
All this certainly makes sense but has yet to be tested.
